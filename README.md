# Machine Learning for Kaggle's Titanic Competition: Support Vector Machine

## Project Overview
This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning competition. It explores the use of SVM for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is available on Kaggle: [Titanic Machine Learning Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Data Cleaning
- Factorizing, combining, and creating new variables
- Mice imputation for handling missing data

### Part 2: Predictive Modeling
Implementation of various SVM models:
- SVM Linear
- SVM Polynomial
- SVM Radial Basis Function Kernel
- Fine-tuning models and exporting results

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed
3. Run the code sequentially to reproduce the analysis
4. Check the exported results for submission to Kaggle

## Feedback
Constructive feedback is always welcome. Feel free to share any suggestions or improvements you might have.

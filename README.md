# Machine Learning for Kaggle's Titanic Competition: Support Vector Machine
This is a machine learning/prediction modeling project for Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning competition. Here, I am trying out a newly learned machine learning technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM). <br />
The competition and dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic. <br />
Please feel free to leave any feedback :)

# Part 1: Data Cleaning 
  Factorizing, combining, and creative new variables <br />
  Mice imputation <br />

# Part 2: Predictive Modeling
  SVM Linear <br />
  SVM Polynomial <br />
  SVM Radial Basis Function Kernal <br />
  Fine-tuning and exporting results <br />
